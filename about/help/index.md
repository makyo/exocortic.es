*{{ site.title }}* is published using a pair of tools called Jekyll and GitHub. Jekyll allows users to write in Markdown or HTML while publishing within a framework organized into posts, while GitHub allows everyone who would like to submit works, rather than just members of a WordPress site or whatever. The combination is known as GitHub Pages. The downside is that it's a little less intuitive to work with. Provided here is a collection of help pages to make that a little easier to deal with.
