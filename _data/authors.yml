# Instructions:
# Create a top-level entry with a username for linking (starts with a letter,
# contains letters, numbers, and underscores). Within that entry, you will need
# a uri which must be http://your-site.com/about/contributors#<id> where <id>
# is the key for the top-level entry (this is for jekyll-feed, which needs to
# know how to link to your profile), a name for displaying, a bio (markdown is
# permitted), and an optional metadata list, which contains a list of objects.
#
# Supported metadata types are:
#   * twitter
#   * github
#   * website
#
# Keep this file ordered alphabetically by username. A suggestion, given the style in which branches are notated in the PS universe, would be to structure the name entry as "Proper Name#username" and mention instances in your bio.
